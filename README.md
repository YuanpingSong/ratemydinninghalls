What's Bruin?

Our project is called "What's Bruin?", which contains both a web and mobile application. The purpose of this project is to
provide a way to provide feedback on the UCLA dining halls. Users will be able to rate each dining halls and the 
individual dishes that each dining hall serves. Additionally, similar to review sites such as Yelp, users will be able to
gauge a general overview of each dining hall.

Motivation

We decided to build this project because we all share a passion for food, and UCLA's dining hall is among the best in the
country. However, there does not currently exist a convenient system for students to provide feedback. Therefore, in order
to continuously improve the quality of food, we decided to create "What's Bruin?" to fill this missing functionality.
